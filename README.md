# Sentimental-analysis
This project focuses on analyzing and interpreting the emotional tone behind textual data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By processing user-generated content—such as reviews, tweets, or comments—the model classifies sentiments into categories like positive, negative, or neutral.
